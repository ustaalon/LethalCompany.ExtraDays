Adding menu item under "Other" named "Buydays" to allow you purchase an extra days.

## Misc Changes
This mod makes some changes to how the terminal works, that isn't fully integral to custom commands.

These changes are as such:

* Reduces the delay after entering the terminal before you can type by 80%
    
  *  You ever open the terminal and start typing, even hearing the keyboard sound, but it doesn't write anything? This fixes that.

* Disable scrolling to the top of the terminal on every command execution
  *  This now only happens when a command clears the screen.

    
* Trims newlines from the start of command responses
  *  The game force adds newlines to the start of commands, which causes issues for commands that don't clear the terminal.
