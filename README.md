# Extra Days
Allows the player to purchase an extra day via the terminal. This mod's uniqueness is that it tries to be more realistic with the game, as it is not trying to modify the main logic of the deadline. It tries to add functionality that will give you extends for the deadline but with some price on it. You can buy as many days as you want if you have enough credits. Every cycle (all days passed), the game deadline will reset to defaults - 3 days.

## How To Use? (only host can do it)
1. Enter the ship's terminal
2. Go to the `Other` category
3. Execute the `buyday` menu item
4. CONFIRM / DENY purchase of an extra day

All players need to have the mod installed to play.

## Modpacks
This mod gets updates frequently and does have support. Make sure you have the latest version. If you facing any issues, do let me know.

### If you are using it with DynamicDeadline or ProgressiveDeadline mod
I made the relevant adjustments so it will work without any issues so that you can play both mods together. Moreover, I fix two major issues that happens when you have higher deadline:
- Enemies not spawning when you have a deadline higher than 10 days or more
- Negative buying rate from the company

So by using my mod, it will fix those issues for both of them.
