# Extra Days
Allows the player to purchase an extra day via the terminal. This mod's uniqueness is that it tries to be more realistic with the game, as it is not trying to modify the main logic of the deadline. It tries to add functionality that will give you extends for the deadline but with some price on it.

## How To Use?
1. Enter terminal
2. Go to 'Other' menu item
3. Go to 'Buydays' menu item
4. CONFIRM / DENY purchase of an extra day
