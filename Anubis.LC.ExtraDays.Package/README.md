# Extra Days
Allows the player to purchase an extra day via the terminal. This mod's uniqueness is that it tries to be more realistic with the game, as it is not trying to modify the main logic of the deadline. It tries to add functionality that will give you extends for the deadline but with some price on it. You can buy many days as you want, if you have enough credits for it. Every cycle (all days passed) game deadline will reset to defaults - 3 days.

## How To Use? (only host can do it)
1. Enter the ship's terminal
2. Go to the `Other` category
3. Execute the `buyday` menu item
4. CONFIRM / DENY purchase of an extra day

All players need to have the mod installed to play.

### What do you think about the price of a day?
Please [let me know](https://discord.com/channels/1168655651455639582/1190842600534573056) what do you think - is it too expensive? should it be correlated or not to the quota or is it too cheap?

### If you are using it with DynamicDeadline mod
I did the relevant adjustments so it will work without any issues, so you can play both mods together. Moreover, I fix two major issues that happens when you have higher deadline:
- Enemies not spawning when you have deadline higher than 10 days or more
- Negative buying rate from the company

So by using this mod, it will fix those issues for both of them.
